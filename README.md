## Deployment

Deployment happens automatically on merge to `main`. See https://us-east-2.console.aws.amazon.com/amplify/home?region=us-east-2#/

Releases are automically tagged and built on pushes to `main` using a github action. Version numbers used for the tags generated automatically by increasing the patch number by one.
